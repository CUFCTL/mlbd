## LaTeX

LaTeX is a tool for creating nicely formatted documents. Lots of math teachers use it for worksheets and tests, lots of conferences and journals use it for research papers. The easiest way to use LaTeX is through [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), which provides a WYSIWYG interface and [documentation](https://v2.overleaf.com/learn) on how to use LaTeX.

If you want to learn more about how to use LaTeX, the best way to learn is to take documents that you've written and re-create them in LaTeX. Overleaf has templates created by the community for all kinds of documents, including resumes, reports, and much more.
