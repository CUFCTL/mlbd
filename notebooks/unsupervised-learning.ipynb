    "In the \"Supervised Learning\" notebook we introduced the idea of a \"task\" and we studied the family of supervised learning tasks, in which the goal is to learn some kind of mapping from labeled data. This description probably begs the question -- what if the data is unlabeled? Would we even be able to do anything with it? It turns out there are a number of things we can still learn about the data; algorithms that work with unlabeled data are called __unsupervised learning__ algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the task is to learn something about the structure of the data. There are a lot of ways we can define the kind of \"structure\" that we want. For example, we could try to group data points into categories based on their values; this task is called __clustering__. As another example, we could take a high-dimensional dataset and try to respresent it somehow in 2D or 3D so that we can visualize it; this task is called __dimensionality reduction__. In this notebook we will look at these two tasks, as they are some of the most common in unsupervised learning. We will continue to use the Iris dataset and other toy datasets from scikit-learn and seaborn.\n",

We call this phenomenon the __curse of dimensionality__. It is especially true for image datasets, since images can easily contain thousands of pixels. Dimensionality reduction techniques can help us with both of these problems: we can transform a dataset into 2 or 3 dimensions for __visualization__, or more generally we can perform __feature extraction__, in which we transform a dataset into some lower-dimensional space that should contain more signal and less noise.\n",

    "We went ahead and colored each data points by class. Remember that this dataset consists of images of handwritten digits, so each data point is an image and the class denotes which digit it is. But even with the first two components, the 10 classes are still pretty mixed up. We could separate the classes pretty well if we could use more components -- we know this from the classification experiment that we just ran -- but when we're limited to only two components it's hard to get good class separation. For this reason, PCA is generally pretty limited as a visualization tool, unless the first two components have a very high explained variance."
