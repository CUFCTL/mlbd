    "_Note: It is recommended that you run this notebook with a GPU._\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"Neural Networks, Part 1\" notebook we introduced the most basic ways to build neural networks using fully-connected layers. This model is extremely general, which means that it will work with most types of data. However, there are some cases where we can take advantage of the structure of the data to improve our networks tremendously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now the field which is booming the most from deep learning is __computer vision__, especially for autonomous driving. Computer vision is about giving machines the ability to see; naturally, the primary type of data that we deal with in computer vision is image data. So far we've treated an image as simply a list of pixels, with no regard to the overall structure of the image. When we do this, we several key aspects of images:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pixels tend to be similar (correlated) to their neighboring pixels\n",
    "- Objects in an image can vary in location, size, rotation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could modify our neural network so that it could take advantage of these properties of images? As it turns out, we can accomplish these things with __convolution__. Convolution is actually a very old technique that goes back to computer vision and then even further back to signal processing. In this notebook we're going to comandeer convolution for our own purposes as a __convolutional layer__, which can be plugged into a neural network to create a __convolutional neural network__, and we'll go through some additional details that come into play when using these layers. Finally, we'll take our original MLP image classifier, super-charge it with some convolutional layers, and see the difference in performance and accuracy."

    "\n",
    "There are a lot of buzzwords in our field, and __deep learning__ is by far the worst of them. Deep learning is considered a subset of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. So everything we've done so far is definitely machine learning -- but at what point does machine learning also become deep learning? The answer is that this boundary isn't really well-defined. Deep learning generally refers to machine learning with \"deep\" models -- but by the same token, what makes a model \"deep\"? For this reason it's better to avoid the term \"deep learning\", because most people don't really know what it means. But as a guideline, if you're using neural networks with several layers -- and especially if you're using convolutional layers -- then you're probably doing \"deep learning\"."

The height and width are intuitive -- in this figure they are 32x32 -- but you may not be used to thinking of an image as having \"depth\". So far we've only worked with grayscale images, where each pixel has a single \"gray\" value. In a color image, however, each pixel has three components: red, green, and blue. This type of color image is called an __RGB image__, and the components are called __channels__. Now we can stack these channels so that the image is actually 32x32x3. This means that our kernel -- the small dark red square inside the image -- will also have a depth of 3, in addition to whatever it's width and height are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blue cube, which we call the __output volume__, represents the neurons in the output layer. The kernel will be the weight matrix of the convolutional layer, that is, it will represent the connections from the input layer to each neuron in the output layer. There are two key aspects to understand here. First, each neuron in the ouput volume is connected to only a small region of input pixels, rather than all of the input pixels as in a fully-connected layer. Second, every neuron is sharing the same weight matrix! Can you see how this structure is addressing exactly the problems we mentioned before? Now we are focusing on neighboring regions of pixels instead of whole images, and we're accounting for the fact that certain patterns could occur anywhere in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there's one more thing that we kind of ignored: why is the output a _cube_?! Shouldn't it just be a square? The answer is yes, it would be a square, _if we were only using one kernel_. When we use convolutional layers, we almost always have several kernels in each layer. Each kernel slides across the input image in exactly the same way, but because the kernels will be initialized differently, the idea is that they will each learn a different pattern in the image. One kernel might learn a vertical edge, another kernel a horizontal edge, a third kernel a diagonal edge, and so on. See the blue circles forming a column in the output volume? We call that a __depth column__ -- it represents a group of neurons that are looking at the same region in an image, but through different kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how big is the output volume? The depth is equal to the number of filters -- every filter produces an activation map. The weight and height depend on a number of factors, which we can summarize in the following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_o = (W_i - F + 2 P) / S + 1$$\n",
    "$$H_o = (H_i - F + 2 P) / S + 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $(W_i, H_i)$ is the input size, $F$ is the width/height of the filter (which we assume is square), $P$ is the amount of __zero padding__, and $S$ is the __stride__. Zero padding refers to adding a border of zeros around the input image, and the stride refers to how far the kernel steps when it slides across the input. We almost always use $F = 2 P + 1$ and $S = 1$, which makes these equations simpler (just a little bit):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W_o = W_i$$\n",
    "$$H_o = W_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we leave the stride set to 1 (just like the convolution examples from before) and we fix the filter size and zero padding so that the output volume always has the same width and height as the input -- if we use 3x3 kernels then we'll add one layer of zeros, if we use 5x5 kernels then we'll add two layers of zeros, and so on. It's just simpler that way."

The figure above shows a 2x2 __max-pooling layer__, because each chunk is 2x2 and the maximum value is taken from each chunk. There are other types of pooling layers, like min-pooling and mean-pooling, but max-pooling tends to give the best results, and with good reason.

To that end, create and train a variety of networks by experimenting with the following hyperparameters:\n",
