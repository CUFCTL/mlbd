It's clear that these two species (which we can identify as `versicolor` and `virginica` thanks to the legend) are stuck together, and any machine learning algorithm we throw at the data will have a hard time distinguishing these two. How can we deal with this problem? The primary way to make data easier to separate is to __add more features__; in other words, add a third or fourth axis along which we might be able to separate the two classes. Now we can't go back to 1936 and tell Ronald Fisher to add more types of measurements, but remember that __we're only looking at two dimensions at a time__. For any given scatter plot above there are two dimensions being excluded, which means that `versicolor` and `virginica` may in fact be separable if we just use the entire dataset instead of only two dimensions. We will revisit this question later when we begin to look at machine learning algorithms."
