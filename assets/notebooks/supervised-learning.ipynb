    "\n",
    "In the \"Working with Data\" notebook we emphasized the importance of understanding your data. The next step in designing a machine learning system is to __understand your task__. That is, what are you trying to accomplish with youe system? Do you have reason to believe that it can be done by a machine? In theory, if a human can perform some task, a machine can probably perform that task too. This statement comes with many caveats and considerations which we will continue to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will study a class of tasks called __supervised learning__. In supervised learning, the task is to predict an output given an input; in mathematical terms, any supervised learning algorithm simply tries to learn the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(\\vec{x})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\vec{x}$ is the input, $y$ is the output, and $f(\\vec{x})$ is the underlying relationship that we are trying to learn. We have already seen an example of such an input / output pair: the Iris dataset. In that dataset, the four features form the input and the species label is the output. We can then imagine a system that predicts the species of a flower based on it's four features, and in fact that's the first thing we'll do in this notebook. This particular task is called __classification__, because the output is a categorical or discrete variable; the other task we'll study is __regression__, in which the output is a continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we used the entire dataset; in general, however, we may not always do that. A dataset can have more than one type of label, or a lot of features that might not all be relevant. When selecting a dataset to perform a task, we also select which features and label(s) to use based on the task.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$y = f(\\vec{x}; \\vec{\\theta})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we say that $f(\\vec{x}; \\vec{\\theta})$ is our __model__, and $\\vec{\\theta}$ is the set of __parameters__ which define our model. This form is one of the most basic ways to describe pretty much any supervised learning algorithm. The important thing to understand is that $\\theta$ can be __literally anything__; we can have as many parameters as we want, and we can arrange them into whatever mathematical expression we want. The learning algorithm (in this case, the classifier) that we choose will determine the structure of these parameters and how they are fitted to best perform the task. We won't explore the mathematical structure of every learning algorithm in these notebooks; for those details we refer you to several well-known resources which can be found on the course website. We only provide this basic formulation to aid your intuition.\n",

To do this, we'll split our dataset into two parts: a __training set__ which will be used to fit the model, and a __testing set__ which will be used to evaluate the model at the end.

    "In the classification and regression examples above, we always created a training set and testing set so that we could evaluate each model on unseen data. Withholding data in this manner is a critical aspect of supervised learning because the entire goal of a supervised learning system is to understand a task given a finite number of examples. If we evaluated a model with data it had already seen, we would quickly run the risk of __overfitting__, in which a model essentially memorizes the training set and fails to learn the actual task.\n",

To deal with this problem, we'll have to split our dataset three ways: a training set, a __validation set__, and a testing set. That's a lot of splits, especially for a small dataset, so we use a technique called __cross-validation (CV)__ to make our dataset go a little further. With cross-validation, we will still only create a training set and testing set, but we'll split the training set into __folds__, or equally sized partitions. Then, when we evaluate a model with a particular hyperparameter setting, we'll actually train and evaluate it several times, using a different fold each time as the validation set, and average the scores. This particular method is called __k-fold cross-validation__, and it allows us to compare models without ever touching the test set.\n",
